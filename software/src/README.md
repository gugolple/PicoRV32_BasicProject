# Clasic and basic compilation of the source files

This is the original compilation way. A lot simpler but without all the
advantages of having the autotools logic.

All the logic is located within 'Makefile'. A far more condense way of understanding the compilation of the proyect. This will remain here and updated. It does create all expected outputs.

This will not create a native binary for simulation as it will be in the Autotools version.
